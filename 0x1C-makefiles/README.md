##0x1C. C - Makefiles

* make is a build automation tool used in software development to compile and build projects. It reads a file called a "Makefile" which contains rules specifying how to derive target programs or files from source files. The primary purpose of make is to determine automatically which pieces of a large program need to be recompiled and issue the commands to recompile them.

* A Makefile typically consists of a set of rules, each specifying how to build a target file or files. Each rule has a target, dependencies, and commands.
